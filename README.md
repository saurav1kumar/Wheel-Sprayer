Title: Development of Low-Cost Battery Operated Wheel Sprayer for Efficient Crop Protection

Introduction:

India's agricultural-based economy heavily relies on farming, and the majority of the population (approximately 75%) is dependent on it.
Agriculture contributes about 18% to the total GDP and provides employment to over 50% of the population.
Traditional farming methods have been predominant, and there is a need for more efficient crop protection techniques.
Objectives:

Design and develop a low-cost battery operated wheel sprayer for crop protection.
Evaluate the sprayer's efficiency, including spray width, speed, and nozzle discharge.
Provide an environmentally friendly and cost-effective solution for Indian farmers.
Methodology:

Selected materials like plastic, brass, stainless steel, and rubber for fabrication.
Created a frame with a battery-powered pressure pump, liquid container, wheels, and nozzle system.
Conducted laboratory and field tests to measure spray width, speed, and nozzle discharge.
Results:

The developed sprayer showcased a wide spray width of 1.74 meters during testing.
Operating at a speed of 0.27 meters per second, it efficiently covered the cultivated area.
Each nozzle consistently discharged 5.18, 5.78, and 5.75 milliliters per second for uniform application.
The sprayer delivered an impressive spray quantity of 260.2 milliliters over 50 square meters.
Cost-Efficiency:

The total fabrication cost of the sprayer was Rs. 6,930, making it a cost-effective solution.
Compared to hand-operated and ground wheel sprayers, the developed sprayer demonstrated superior cost-effectiveness.
Conclusion:

The low-cost battery operated wheel sprayer offers an innovative and efficient solution for crop protection.
Its wide spray width, precise application, and cost-effectiveness make it a valuable tool for Indian farmers.
This development paves the way for modernizing agriculture and promoting sustainable practices in the farming sector.
